## 📂 [ MISSION_BRIEF ]

This repository hosts the source code for **Satish Rohit Singh's** interactive portfolio. Unlike static resume sites, this project deploys a **Generative AI Digital Twin** that serves as a live demonstration of my capabilities in:

1.  **RAG Architecture:** The agent parses my real resume to answer complex questions (e.g., *"How did you handle fraud detection in South Africa?"*).
2.  **Multimodal Analysis:** The system can ingest PDF Job Descriptions and perform a semantic "Fit/Gap" analysis against my vector-embedded skills.
3.  **Frontend Engineering:** A custom-built React interface featuring a "Brutalist/Cyberpunk" aesthetic with real-time audio visualization.

## 🏗️ [ SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE ]

This project demonstrates a full-stack AI implementation:

### **1. The Brain (Backend)**
* **Logic:** Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** via custom Python agents.
* **Memory:** Uses **Vector Database (Pinecone)** for semantic retrieval of my career history.
* **Tools:**
    * `JD_Matcher`: A custom pipeline that extracts entities from uploaded PDFs and cross-references them with my experience.

### **2. The Interface (Frontend)**
* **Core:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite.
* **UI/UX:** TailwindCSS with a custom "System Terminal" design system.
* **Audio:** Web Speech API for real-time voice interaction.
